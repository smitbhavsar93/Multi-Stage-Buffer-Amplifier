# Multi-Stage-Buffer-Amplifier

•	Designed a circuit with a 3-stage 2N3904 transistor configurations with a single-supply that included a multistage, inverting, transistor amplifier to meet electrical requirement 
•	Circuit was tested and designed upon Multisim software for voltage gain, quiescent current and input / output resistance
•	Results were confirmed through the waveforms upon generation
